* Pre-commit hooks

Some quick pre-commit hooks that I have found useful.

You can drop scripts like the ones below under ~.git/hooks/pre-commit~ for example; it should have the executable bit set with ~chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit~.

** Format Python with black

This script will run the [[https://github.com/psf/black][black source code formatter]] on the git diffs of Python files only. It seems overly complicated because I tried to avoid certain issues [fn:path-issue]

#+begin_src sh
  #!/bin/sh

  if ! command -v black > /dev/null 2>&1; then
      printf "black is not installed. See <%s>." \
             "https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" 2>&1
      exit 1
  fi
  unset -v GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS
  staged=$(git diff -z --name-only --staged -- '*.py' | base64)
  printf "%s" "$staged" | base64 -d | xargs -0 black -q
  modified=$(git diff -z --name-only --diff-filter=M -- '*.py' | base64)
  printf "%s" "$staged" | base64 -d \
      | (printf "%s" "$modified" | base64 -d && cat) \
      | sort -z | uniq -z -d \
      | xargs -0 git add
#+end_src

[fn:path-issue] See the article [[https://dwheeler.com/essays/filenames-in-shell.html][Filenames and Pathnames in Shell: How to do it Correctly]] by David A. Wheeler.

** Format C and C++ with clang-format

This script will run [[https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html][clang-format]] on the git diffs of C and C++ files (source and header) only. It doesn't work for tricky filenames that contain newlines, so do not use it with untrusted repositories.

#+begin_src sh
  #!/bin/sh

  if ! command -v clang-format > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    printf "clang-format is not installed. See <%s>." \
           "https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html" 2>&1
    exit 1
  fi
  git clang-format --staged \
    | tail -n +2 \
    | xargs git add
#+end_src
